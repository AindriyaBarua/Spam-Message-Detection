# spam-message-detection

This is my Machine Learning Academic project. Implemented Logistic regression, 10 fold cross validation, word embessing "from scratch".

Also compared the accuracies with the generic pre-built classical machine learning models.

Done data visualisation with TSNE plotting.

Also done an unsupervised clusttering, and visualised the clusters.
